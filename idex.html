        <p><em>Just a <strong>lonley</strong> human being</em></p>
        <p>I am just a normal Highschooler, with crippling despression and anxiety.
          I have a passion for working, but zero energy to do it. I have plans set for
          everyingthing, and trying to come along and achive some goals. I am
          currently following along with this course in the hopes of working in this
          field someday, but till then I am still trying.I am decent enough in 3d
          modeling and graphic designing, but decent isn't enough for me. There is a
          lot I want to learn but there so little time to learn. About personal life
          I am considered fucked up and confuse because I am stupid and doesn't take
          no for an answer. This is why I have reached this point of fucked up.
          I just want to see how this life unfold before my very eyes. But one thing
          I know that you will be the death of me ðŸ–¤.
